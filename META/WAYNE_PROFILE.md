## Professional Summary

Wayne Wang is an **AI systems engineer** with a unique combination of research rigor and product instincts. His work spans:

- **Research (Critique → Construction)**: Published work exposing flaws in AI evaluation (ACL 2026), now building leakage-controlled forecasting infrastructure at UCSD
- **Industry**: Built AI-powered products at ByteDance scale, including RAG systems, diagnostic tools, and data visualization from natural language
- **Products**: Designed 5 complete AI-native products addressing human-AI collaboration at individual, creative, and team scales

What distinguishes Wayne: **He doesn't just find the problems—he builds the solutions.**

---

## The Wayne Wang Narrative

### Origin Story
Started as a CS student interested in both systems and AI. Research experience at NYU revealed a passion for **evaluation methodology**—not just building AI, but rigorously testing whether it actually works.

### Defining Insight
While researching LLM forecasting evaluation, discovered that both external (search results) and internal (model memory) information channels leak—meaning current evaluation methods are fundamentally broken. This led to published work challenging industry assumptions.

**But Wayne didn't stop at critique.** Now building **Systemic World Models** for forecasting—structured representations (Threads, Timelines, Causes) that make leakage impossible by design.

### Applied Philosophy
Every product project addresses the same core problem: **AI outputs exceed human processing capacity**. Solutions range from:
- **Graphex**: Help individuals learn from AI-processed documents
- **Notate**: Help individuals organize AI-captured information
- **Inxtone**: Help writers maintain consistency over AI-generated content
- **VibeHub**: Help teams coordinate when everyone is 26% faster but collectively slower

### Current Chapter
MS at UCSD, working on the **constructive** side of his research—building forecasting infrastructure that addresses the problems his earlier work exposed. Also continuing to build products that bridge the AI-human gap.

## Unique Value Propositions

### For SWE/AI Engineer Roles

**What I bring that's different**:

1. **Research Rigor + Production Speed**
   - Published at ACL while shipping at ByteDance
   - Can evaluate AI systems, not just build them

2. **Systems Thinking at Multiple Scales**
   - Low-level: C++ Redis clone, DSL for build systems
   - High-level: Team collaboration architecture

3. **Product Instincts**
   - Every project has a PRD, not just code
   - User problems before technical solutions

### For Startups

**Why consider Wayne**:
- Can own a product end-to-end (design → ship → evaluate)
- Research background means rigorous approach to AI products
- 5 product concepts show entrepreneurial thinking

### For Research Labs

**Why consider Wayne**:
- Published track record in AI evaluation
- Industry experience grounds research in practical concerns
- Systems skills enable building novel evaluation infrastructure
