## Learning Philosophy

Wayne approaches skill development with a **T-shaped** strategy:

```
Broad Foundation (Horizontal)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Frontend │ Backend │ Data │ DevOps │ Product
         │         │      │        │
         │    Deep Expertise (Vertical)
         │    ┃
         │    ┃ AI/ML Systems
         │    ┃ • Research methodology
         │    ┃ • Production AI
         │    ┃ • Evaluation
         │    ┃
         │    ┃ Systems Programming
         │    ┃ • Low-level optimization
         │    ┃ • Infrastructure at scale
         │    ┃
```

**Core Principle**: Deep enough to build production systems, broad enough to design complete products.
