# Inxtone 砚台 — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** February 2026
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Inxtone is an **open-source, local-first CLI tool** with a web-based UI that helps writers create long-form serial fiction (web novels) with structural integrity and commercial viability. It combines literary craft principles with AI assistance to solve the core problem: AI can generate text, but it can't tell stories that hold up at scale.

**Architecture:** CLI + Local Web UI (similar to Ollama, Jupyter)
- Run `inxtone serve` → opens `localhost:3456` with full-featured writing interface
- All data stored locally as **Markdown files + SQLite index**
- **Git-friendly** project structure for version control
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** for Gemini API

**Core Value Proposition:**
- For Chinese market (网文市场): 让AI真正懂得讲故事，而不只是生成文字
- For International market: Turn AI from a text generator into a story architect
- For developers/power users: Open source, hackable, no vendor lock-in

brew install inxtone          # macOS
cargo install inxtone         # From source
# or download binary from GitHub releases

# Quick Commands (headless)
inxtone add character "林逸"  # Add character from CLI

```

### 7.4 Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Core Runtime | **Rust** | Fast, single binary, cross-platform, no runtime deps |
| HTTP Server | Axum | Rust-native, async, lightweight |
| Frontend | **React + Vite** | Familiar stack, fast HMR, easy to embed |
| Editor | TipTap / CodeMirror 6 | Markdown-native, extensible |
| Storage | **Markdown files** | Human-readable, git-friendly, portable |
| Index/Search | **SQLite + FTS5** | Zero-config, fast full-text search |
| AI | **Gemini API (BYOK)** | User provides key, no server costs |
| Packaging | Single binary + embedded frontend | Easy distribution |
| Config | TOML | Human-readable, Rust-friendly |

### 7.5 AI Context Strategy

For million-word novels, context management is critical:

1. **Story Bible as Structured Markdown**: Frontmatter YAML + body content, parsed into SQLite
2. **Chapter Summaries**: Auto-generated and cached, refreshed on edit
3. **Full-Text Search**: SQLite FTS5 for instant search across all content
4. **Smart Context Assembly**:
   - Current chapter + recent 2 chapters
   - Relevant characters (mentioned in scene)
   - Active foreshadowing threads
   - World rules (always included, compressed)
5. **Token Budget Management**: User can set max context size in config

### 7.6 Data Privacy & Security

- **All data stays local**: Nothing uploaded to any server except Gemini API calls
- **API key stored locally**: `~/.inxtone/config.toml` (chmod 600)
- **Optional encryption**: Future feature for sensitive projects
- **Git-friendly**: Easy to backup, version control, collaborate via git

## 8. MVP Scope (Phase 1)

**Timeline:** 6-10 weeks (faster without server infrastructure)

**Must Have (P0):**
- [ ] `inxtone init` — Project scaffolding
- [ ] `inxtone serve` — Local web UI server
- [ ] Project dashboard (list chapters, word count)
- [ ] Chapter editor (markdown, auto-save to file)
- [ ] Character cards (markdown + frontmatter)
- [ ] World rules (basic structure)
- [ ] Plot outliner (2 levels: Arc → Chapter)
- [ ] Gemini integration (continuation, dialogue)
- [ ] Basic context injection (current chapter + selected entities)
- [ ] `inxtone export --txt` — TXT export
- [ ] `inxtone export --docx` — Word export
- [ ] `inxtone config` — API key management

**Should Have (P1):**
- [ ] Relationship map (visual, D3.js or similar)
- [ ] Foreshadowing tracker
- [ ] Full-text search across project
- [ ] Multiple AI prompt templates
- [ ] `inxtone ask` — CLI query interface

**Nice to Have (P2):**
- [ ] Consistency checker
- [ ] File watcher (auto-reload on external edit)
- [ ] Chapter summaries (auto-generated)
- [ ] Daily word count goals

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Rust learning curve for contributors | Medium | Medium | Good docs, consider Go/Node alternatives for some parts |
| Users don't adopt structured workflow | High | High | Gradual onboarding, allow freeform writing first |
| Context management insufficient for long works | Medium | High | Invest in smart context assembly, user testing |
| Competition from AI writing tools | High | Medium | Focus on structure/consistency + open source advantage |
| Cross-platform compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | CI/CD for all platforms, community testing |
| Gemini API changes/deprecation | Low | High | Abstract AI layer, support multiple providers later |

---

## 11. Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)

**Phase 2: Enhanced AI & Polish (Q2 2026)**
- Advanced consistency checking
- Multi-model support (Claude, GPT, local Ollama)
- Better context management (embeddings, semantic search)
- Plugin/extension system

**Phase 3: Power Features (Q3 2026)**
- Style matching/learning from your writing
- Advanced relationship graph visualization
- Timeline view for plot
- EPUB/Kindle export

**Phase 4: Ecosystem (Q4 2026)**
- Optional cloud sync (encrypted, user-controlled)
- Template marketplace (share Story Bible templates)
- VS Code extension (edit in IDE, sync with web UI)

**Phase 5: Community (2027)**
- Writing challenges/events
- Optional public story sharing
- Community-contributed prompts

---

## 12. Open Questions

1. **Language for Core**: Rust (performant, harder) vs Go (simpler, still fast) vs Node/Bun (JS ecosystem)?
2. **Localization Priority**: UI in English first, or simultaneous EN/CN?
3. **AI Provider Abstraction**: Support only Gemini MVP, or abstract from day 1?
4. **Plugin System**: Should the architecture support plugins/extensions early?
5. **Sync/Backup**: Optional cloud sync feature later? Which provider?
